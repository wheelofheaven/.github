The third key motion of the Earth next to the cycles responsible for the day and the year is the precession of the equinoxes. Its cycle –the Great Year– lasts roughly 24’000 years. By dividing the cycle in 12 houses of 2’000 years, you would be given the key to understand the purpose of the zodiac being a time marker...

Constellations are star patterns used for navigating the night sky. This method of mapping the heavens dates back to prehistory, possibly even earlier.

The Great Year tells an epic story of the origins of humanity across the time spans starting with the Age of Aquarius long ago.

Intercultural understanding passed the climax, warmongering slowly faded away, nations united, science progressed immensely, technology and engineering enabled to produce a great abundance of goods and comfort.

In particular the possibilities of synthetic biology aroused the imagination of a lot of curious minds. The negligence of these early experiments cumulated in an outbreak of ferocious creatures. Consequently, this highly risky field of study was deemed unethical and thus banned. The researchers however didn’t abandon their curiosity and initiated a space exploration program to find a suitable place far away from the jurisdiction of their own government.

It didn’t take them long to find a suitable planet to claim for them. It was evenly covered with water and clouds. The researchers put satellites in orbit to examine the foreign blue planet. Among other, an relatively big moon orbiting the planet was thus placed.

The planet’s constitution and solar radiation needed to be assessed for life sustainability. A wide range of various time-consuming precautionary investigations were undertaken. Multiple exploration flights down into the surface were made as well.

As the long-term effects of solar radiation got deemed not harmful for life, the researcher initiated their next step for space colonization: terraforming a giant single continent.

Having terraformed this giant single continent in the middle of the oceans, the researchers finally had arranged the surface convenient for their needs and purposes. Some more investigations such as geological surveys and the assessment of their relative position in space were done. Astronomical cycles, key motions and other complexities were about to be understood.

With the knowledge of their new home world and the facilities build in the meantime, the researchers had everything in their hand to continue the experiments they once lead on their home planet. This time around, they started from scratch by synthetically creating living cells. The first microbes, fungi, algae and grass leaves saw the surface of the rough planet.

While bacterial and floral life completely altered atmospheric conditions, more sophisticated life forms became viable. The sheer amount of water made the oceans predestined for further experimentation with new species. Thus a wide range of marine creatures were created.

As things progressed, the home planet started to follow closely what new iterations of synthetic life the expatriate researcher had to offer. New enthusiastic people joined the interstellar genesis project. Especially artists were drawn in and were responsible for pushing diversity and creativity even further for mere decorative reasons. As such, colorful fishes, but also birds and dragons started to crawl the surface of the Earth.

After the successful attempts at creating fundamentally distinct life forms, land animals became necessary in order to balance out population growth rates regarding the enormous plurality of various species.

The act of balance demanded a great amount of meticulous gauging of species variety and niche filling. The collective ingenuity and perseverance cumulated in its success. Self-sustaining, highly intricate ecosystems were engineered and started to flourish all around the globe. The whole idea of recreating life elsewhere and making it look and behave however you wanted it to, came to completion. The home planets demographic was still following from very close the astonishing scientific progress.

![wheel-of-heaven-09](https://github.com/wheelofheaven/.github/blob/main/profile/static/wheel-of-heaven-09.png)

Since the early days of terrestrial experimentation, the researcher were split up in seven different groups representing their home planets major cultures. Creative and scientific competitions were organised to compare and judge their creations. After the stunning success of synthetic flora and fauna, these groups were tempted to go on further and make an humanoid species in their image.

It took many iterations to get a favorable result, and very soon, seven archetypical humanoid species were born. Some researchers wanted to improve them even further, but the consensus thought it to be too high of a risk for themselves. Nevertheless, these human-like hominids were kept and studied with high attention. The dwelling place for those beings was called Eden.

![wheel-of-heaven-10](https://github.com/wheelofheaven/.github/blob/main/profile/static/wheel-of-heaven-10.png)

These early human creations, called the generation of Adam & Eve, grew up thinking of the researchers as their parents. This was the moment where the government of the home planet got frightened. Human-like hominids with comparable abilities? The far-away home government started to inspect more and more the ongoing interstellar genesis project.

Therefore, it was forbidden to teach those new synthetic humans anything scientific or technological possibly revealing their true origins. They were however taught everything else such as botany or zoology in order to assess properly their inherent intelligence and abilities. As time passed, the creators and their creation started to have a genuine, bonding parent-children relationship.

![wheel-of-heaven-11](https://github.com/wheelofheaven/.github/blob/main/profile/static/wheel-of-heaven-11.png)

One group of researchers known as the Serpent, loved their humans so much that they told them the truth about the scientific origins of life. Also the possibility to artificially prolong human lifespans was disclosed. Not only that, but the same researchers started to have hybrid children with these humans. This was too much for the home planets authority and decided to make a halt to the ongoing genesis project. Research facilities got destroyed, most researchers were forced to leave and the culpable group was exiled to stay on Earth.

The ongoing cooperation and copulation between the exiled Serpent and the Earthly humans made the unnerved home government plotting for total destruction of remaining life.

![wheel-of-heaven-12](https://github.com/wheelofheaven/.github/blob/main/profile/static/wheel-of-heaven-12.png)

As soon as the Serpent were informed about the coming destruction of all life, they launched a preservation mission by indexing as much  genetic data as they could. With the help of some Earthly humans lead by Noah, they together build the Ark, a storage space shuttle that would safeguard their whole genesis legacy in the secure vastness of interplanetary space.

It proved to be a tremendously laborious task, but fortunately was accomplished in time. Right when the eradicative missile hit the Earth and its impact destroyed all Earthly life by generating a huge tidal wave and cataclysmic weather conditions, the Ark was already well above the planet preserving life. The Earth was thus made inhabitable again and the original landmass split up in a number of continents.

![wheel-of-heaven-13](https://github.com/wheelofheaven/.github/blob/main/profile/static/wheel-of-heaven-13.png)

After Earth was made habitable and life got reimplanted once more, the safeguarded humans migrated onto the numerous continents, rebuilding civilization. With the benevolent help of the exiled Serpent, the Yehudim, heirs of Noah, attempted an interstellar reconciliation mission out of Bavel, but the recipient authority intervened through scattering them around the globe. Some swore revenge, but got fiercely shut down again at Sodom and Gomorrah once more. 

Eventually, the home planets authority decided to not directly intervene anymore and let humanity make progress on their own as they recognized that they were once created alike. In order to see how early civilization perceived them, they contacted their first advocator: Abram.

![wheel-of-heaven-14](https://github.com/wheelofheaven/.github/blob/main/profile/static/wheel-of-heaven-14.png)

As technology got destroyed and scientific progress mostly forgotten. The weakened Yehudim, got subjugated by neighbouring tribes. The immensely advanced creator civilization got worshipped and deified. They were collectively known as Elohim. 

To make sure that the knowledge about the true origins of humanity and Earthly life doesn’t get entirely misunderstood and mystified, the Elohim instruct Moshe to liberate the Yehudim and to accurately pass down their historical legacy.

Many other demystifying advocators, known as prophets being divinely inspired, were contacted around the globe to remember those who created them. Advices were also given to make Earthly life somewhat more comfortable.

![wheel-of-heaven-15](https://github.com/wheelofheaven/.github/blob/main/profile/static/wheel-of-heaven-15.png)

As the Yehudim kept their oral and written traditions exclusively to themselves, Joshua was instructed to democratize the testaments to a global audience regardless of ethnological identification or social status, so that the world would have written proof of all what happened the moment they have the scientific means to understand their origins.

Humanity progressed on its own terms. Some more prophets were sparsely contacted by the Elohim to ensure favourable development. Soon, civilizations started to flourish, slowly becoming more sophisticated and interconnected. There were still lots of fallacious war waging and misallocations of power going on, but progressively, the human mind began to show brilliance and prowess: Science was born.

![wheel-of-heaven-16](https://github.com/wheelofheaven/.github/blob/main/profile/static/wheel-of-heaven-16.png)

As advanced technology and promising energetic sources got discovered, literacy and information available to everyone, human consciousness became globally interconnected. The vast range of contemporary scientific possibilities are arousing the imagination of many curious minds. While living in the same age of sheer abundance and immanent comfort, we hold the key to scientifically understand the seemingly erroneous origins of religious traditions, namely the engineering of synthetic biology.

It happened already and is going to happen again in the great wheel of time. Right now, we’re witnessing the unfolding of prospective technologies convergently concluding in the understanding of the past and the yet-to-come. 

![wheel-of-heaven-17](https://github.com/wheelofheaven/.github/blob/main/profile/static/wheel-of-heaven-17.png)

The precessional Great Year, the ever- grinding millstone of time, tells a wonderful story of origins, despair, fate and hope. Let us recognize the signs of the times, the age of the Fountain finally arrived: Abundance, unity and genuine consciousness are showing the way to the eternal bond between us and infinity itself.
