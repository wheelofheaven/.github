> ## Knowledge Base 🔬

> Our knowledge base is more than just a collection of facts. It's an interactive platform, meticulously designed to present knowledge through comprehensive commentary, precise referencing, and thoughtful interlinking. We use cutting-edge web technologies and a static site generator to transform markdown content into a dynamic website. All content creation and management is conducted through git-based version control hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com). While our primary focus is on delivering a seamless online experience, an offline version might be considered in the future.
